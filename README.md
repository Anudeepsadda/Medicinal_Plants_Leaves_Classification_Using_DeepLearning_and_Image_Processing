# Medicinal_Plants_Leaves_Classification_Using_DeepLearning_and_Image_Processing
#  Description
[This project addresses the challenge of accurately identifying medicinal plants using a deep learning-based approach. Traditional plant identification methods often require specialized botanical knowledge and can be time-consuming. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, this system automates the identification process using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a labeled dataset of medicinal plant leaves.]
# What Problem It Solves
[Facilitates the rapid and accurate identification of medicinal plants.]
[Reduces reliance on expert knowledge for plant recognition.]
[Provides a scalable and efficient solution for researchers, agriculturists, and pharmaceutical industries.]
# Why It Is Useful
[Supports biodiversity conservation efforts by accurately identifying endangered or rare plants.]
[Assists researchers in pharmaceutical studies by identifying plant species with medicinal properties.]
[Enhances agricultural management through automated plant classification.]
# How It Works
[The system uses a custom CNN model as well as the VGG architecture, both developed with TensorFlow and Keras.]
[Input images are preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model robustness.]
[The models perform feature extraction and classification to identify plant species.]
[Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.]
# Unique Features
[High accuracy of 95.3% in medicinal plant identification.]
[Comparative analysis using both custom CNN and VGG architectures.]
[Efficient model architecture optimized for image classification.]
[Integrated preprocessing pipeline to handle varying image conditions.]
[Scalable for deployment on mobile or web-based platforms.]
