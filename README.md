# Medicinal_Plants_Leaves_Classification_Using_DeepLearning_and_Image_Processing
#  Description
[This project addresses the challenge of accurately identifying medicinal plants using a deep learning-based approach. Traditional plant identification methods often require specialized botanical knowledge and can be time-consuming. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, this system automates the identification process using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a labeled dataset of medicinal plant leaves.]
